# ReQuestion.Io

A Grammatical Syntax Analyzer
which analyzes your text to see if you restated the question.

Using clever matching clauses, ReQuestion.Io is able to reorder a question to create a valid restatement, depending on which question type it is. ReQuestion.Io compares this restatement to your input in order to determine whether or not you validly restated the question. ReQuestion.Io currently supports the three most common types of questions:

- Yes/No Questions: Did you go to school today?
- “Wh-” Questions: What happened at school today?
- Choice Questions: Was your school day good or bad?

and subsets between the three.

This project is supported by [FinNLP](https://github.com/FinNLP/fin) and [Compromise.js](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise).

Thanks to @spencermountain to introducing me to the world of Natural Language Processing.

## Info

`website` - The Requestion.Io website, built with Parcel

`website-new` - The Requestion.Io website, rebuilt to work with the NPM package (`TODO`)

`package` - a barebones version of `website` built to be published to NPM

## Accuracy

Out of 254 cases where the response is a restatement of the question, ReQuestion was 100% correct, except in an edge case where the FinNLP made an error. Out of 62 cases where the response is NOT a restatement of the question, ReQuestion was 100% correct.

## Terminology (used above)

`TODO`

## How I did this

This is honestly my first serious coding project, so expect it to be very lazily and badly made. Nevertheless, this is my journey:

`TODO`
